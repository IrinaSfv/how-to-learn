### Landing page about best practices for learning new skills.

In this project, I've learned how to:
* use semantic layout in HTML,
* work with animations, fonts and frames,
* use FlexBox in CSS,
* use the BEM methodology working with tags and the file structure.

* Run `GitBash` (or `Terminal` on MacOS);
* Select or create a new repository where you want to put the project;
* Run the command: `git clone https://github.com/IrinaSfv/how-to-learn.git`;
* Open the project in any convenient code editor.

## Usage
You can view the current version of the page by following the link:
